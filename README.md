# Enhanced SPI & Timer Driver Project

## Overview
This project provides a portable, professional SPI and Timer driver implementation suitable for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, with a focus on code quality and documentation. It is designed to be easily adaptable for Qualcomm platforms and includes simulation/test stubs for environments without hardware access.

## Features
- Portable SPI and Timer drivers (Cortex-M, Qualcomm-ready)
- Modular code structure
- Doxygen documentation
- Makefile for building
- Example main application
- Simulation/test stubs

## Directory Structure
- `src/` : Source files
- `include/` : Header files
- `test/` : Test and simulation code
- `Makefile` : Build system
- `README.md` : Project documentation

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Run tests (simulation)**
   ```bash
   make test
   ./test/test_spi_timer
   ```

## Porting to Qualcomm
- Replace hardware-specific register access with Qualcomm platform APIs or HAL.
- Use provided abstraction layers for SPI and Timer.

## Documentation
- Doxygen comments are included in all source files.
- Generate documentation with:
   ```bash
   doxygen Doxyfile
   ```
